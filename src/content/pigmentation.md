Pigment cells, where melanin synthesis takes place, are called melanocytes, and the process itself - melanogenesis, which is regulated from internal (genetic, hormonal) and external (UV radiation, chemical) factors. Melanogenesis starts with melanin synthesis from the tyrosine amino acid, found in melanocytes, under the stimulus of the tyrosinase enzyme. Activation of tyrosinase is realized in the presence of reactive oxygen, copper ions and under the stimulus of UV rays.

Melanin accumulates in specific structures - melanosomes, which migrate from melanocytes to keratinocytes in the epidermis. It acts out as a defence mechanism in the skin: under the stimulus of solar radiation, free radicals are released, melanin catches them, and, in this way, it protects epidermal cells from harm. The level and intensity of pigmentation depends on the activeness of melanocytes and their count. The main reason for pigment changes is imbalance in the synthesis and breakdown of melanin, i.e., disorders in the melanogenesis process.

Hyperpigmentation is a common condition in which dark sports appear on the face and body, as a result of accumulation of the melanin pigment in the surface layers of the skin.The production of melanin is a defense reaction of the skin and it acts as a shield to ultraviolet radiation, causing photodamage and premature aging.

The main reasons for the appearance of pigment spots are sunrays, hormonal imbalance, again, intake of oral contraceptives and other medicine, traumas and inflammatory processes of the skin, as well as after aggressive cosmetic procedures.The most common forms of hyperpigmentation are freckles, melasma (chloasma, “pregnancy mask”), senile lentigo (age spots), senile keratosis, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, post-acne pigmentation, ect. Sun exposure after the appear-acne of such spots may increase their development and may present a serious aesthetic problem. Sometimes pigmentation may deteriorate and provoke an oncological skin condition.
