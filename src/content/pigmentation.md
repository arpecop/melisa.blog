Pigment cells, where melanin synthesis takes place, are called melanocytes, and the process itself - melanogenesis, which is regulated from internal (genetic, hormonal) and external (UV radiation, chemical) factors. Melanogenesis starts with melanin synthesis from the tyrosine amino acid, found in melanocytes, under the stimulus of the tyrosinase enzyme. Activation of tyrosinase is realized in the presence of reactive oxygen, copper ions and under the stimulus of UV rays.

Melanin accumulates in specific structures - melanosomes, which migrate from melanocytes to keratinocytes in the epidermis. It acts out as a defence mechanism in the skin: under the stimulus of solar radiation, free radicals are released, melanin catches them, and, in this way, it protects epidermal cells from harm. The level and intensity of pigmentation depends on the activeness of melanocytes and their count. The main reason for pigment changes is imbalance in the synthesis and breakdown of melanin, i.e., disorders in the melanogenesis process.
