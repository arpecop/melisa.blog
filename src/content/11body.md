##4.Consume carbohydrates before and after a workout.

Many beginners make a mistake by overestimating protein intake at the expense of **carbohydrates**. They are essential to boost muscle growth because they help restore muscles and give them nutrients. Those who are fast-consuming carbohydrates should be consumed immediately after a workout. Fast carbohydrates should be consumed: **dextrose, maltodextrin, fructose, palatinose.**

It is a good rule to take before and after a workout. If you have taken 100 grams of carbohydrates, divide them equally before and after a workout. Carbohydrates such as starch **(wholegrain bread and pasta**), and slowly digestible carbohydrates (**oatmeal, sweet potatoes and brown rice)**. The only exception is to reduce carbohydrates late at night, as they will more easily be stored as body fat at this time of day.

##6.Take **vitamin C** to support recovery and growth.

Vitamins and **minerals** are necessary for health. Often young bodybuilders underestimate recovery after heavy workouts. When conducting a workout, the body produces more free radicals, highly reactive molecules that damage cells. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and neutralizes harmful molecules. Other such antioxidants also include **vitamin E,** beta-carotene and selenium. Recent research has shown that vitamin C also provides energy useful for those who train hard as well as those who lead sedentary lifestyles. It is taken starting with small doses of vitamin C, taking 500-1000 mg once or twice a day.The dose may be increased slowly, adding 500 mg per day each week, reaching a total of 2000-4000 mg per day, within 2-4 doses of 500-1000 mg each.
