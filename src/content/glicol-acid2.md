Glycolic acid is well known in face and body care products.

It is now one of the most studied acids, which is why it is so common in cosmetic and medical procedures.

Chemically, it is a tiny molecule that can easily penetrate the skin, reaching the deepest layers, causing intense, lasting and visible effects.

It is a natural acid and comes from sugar cane. It belongs to the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA), along with others such as malic and lactic acid.

###Characteristics of glycolic acid

It is a colorless, water-soluble, high-capacity hygroscopic substance, as well as other known hygroscopic substances, to retain water inside and significantly improve skin hydration, a factor that cannot be forgotten in preventing the normal and natural physiological aging of your leather.

###Medical use of glycolic acid

This acid is used by many dermatologists, surgeons and cosmetologists who apply it in high concentrations and very low pH. This acidity makes it so effective in pathologies such as photoaging, wrinkles, acne, melasma, scars and more.

###Wrinkle treatment

Glycolic acid is a chemical peel, so it performs a great function of improving the layers of the skin and, depending on its characteristics, acts on a very superficial level, where there are dead skin cells (known as the stratum corneum) or a deeper lever, where it acts directly on the dermoepidermal ligament.

###Treatment of skin imperfections

It is also one of the most widely used alpha hydroxy acids for dark melanin-type defects, most commonly in pregnant women, sun-exposed skin, those with a certain predisposition to blemishes, or in women taking contraceptives, although there are many causes for spots of this kind.

With its great exfoliating power, glycolic acid manages to reduce this type of lesions that make us so uncomfortable and difficult to treat.

But if you are undergoing this type of treatment, it is essential to use high UV protection, at least SPF 50.

And as we always say, even if you don't use glycolic acid, never forget to use sunscreen!

###Acne treatment

There is no doubt that the results are very positive for acne, as it "polishes" the epidermis, improving it and reducing the appearance of hyperkeratosis in the sebaceous gland of the hair follicle, which we call spots or blackheads. This improves the mechanism of keratinization and cell death.

###Acne scars

The results with this type of lesion are also very positive, but you should keep in mind that in these scars there is some dermal atrophy, lack of deep tissue, so it is very difficult to treat them, as you have to reach the deepest layer of skin, papillary dermis.

###Hydration of the skin

As we said, glycolic acid is hygroscopic, it can capture water molecules, which is one of the properties that a substance with high hydrating power must have, so it is also recommended for hydrating procedures.

###Glycolic acid in cosmetics

This is one of the most widely used skin care treatments as it provides good results and is less "aggressive" than other substances.

Of course, you need to make sure that your beautician is responsible and knows how to work with this type of acid.

When is glycolic acid used at home?

First, it is important to keep in mind that this type of acid can only be used in the fall and winter, in other words, when you are not exposed to solar radiation.

We do not recommend using it in the spring and even less in the summer.

Another thing to keep in mind is to always apply it about an hour before bed to start working beforehand.

###How to use it at home?

First clean your face with your normal cosmetic product, removing makeup very well, then apply a tonic and finally a cosmetic product with glycolic acid.

To supplement the treatment you can apply another cosmetic product with vitamin C (a powerful antioxidant and anti-free radicals), hyaluronic acid, kojic acid (if you are prone to blemishes) during the day (always before sunscreen).

Remember that glycolic acid slightly improves your skin and thus all the active ingredients that you subsequently apply will penetrate much better into it.
