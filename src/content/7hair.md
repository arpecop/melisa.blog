Each of us has ever been in a situation requiring smooth and tender skin, and then we begin to bother with the same question – "How to get rid of annoying hair?" The ways are many from the epilator to the waxing, razor and chemical depilation. These are the easiest and cheapest ways, but therefore the most problematic. The effect of these methods is short-lived, after each procedure the hairs get rough, often grow and form folliculitis. In addition, the application of chemical depilatories can lead to allergic reactions of the skin. The situation is familiar to many of you, isn't it? Permanent hair removal can be achieved only by destroying the hair follicle, that is, by hair removal. The most effective, harmless and at the same time with a long-lasting effect method of removing undesirable hair is laser hair removal.

###What is laser hair removal and what is its advantage?

With laser hair removal, the light emitted is absorbed by the pigment into the hair stems and follicles and transformed into heat, which leads to their demise. In this way, light selectively affects hair structures without damage to the surrounding skin.

###What are the main advantages of laser hair removal?

Lasting effect after the course of hair removal
Absence of irritation, allergic reactions or infectious folliculitis
Laser light helps to quickly and effectively influence existing inflammatory processes
Excludes skin feedback associated with hair growth stimulation
No skin side effects in the treated area

###Who is this type of procedure suitable for?

For men and women of all skin types.

###Which areas can be treated?

All areas of the body can be subjected to laser hair removal – in practice, there are no restrictions on the areas that can be treated.

###How many procedures are needed?

The number of procedures is individual and depends on many factors: hair structure, processed area, age, hormonal background, medication intake, etc. For body areas, usually their number is about 7, and for a person – about 10. With a stable hormonal background, the good cosmetic effect of hair removal persists from several months to several years.

###Why is a course of procedures required?

Three phases of hair growth are distinguished. At the first – active phase, the hair stem formed in the follicle is in the process of growth. At the second – phase of rest, the hair is in a stable state. In the third – phase of hair dropping, the stem is missing, and the hair follicle is a sticky sac of cells. Laser light permanently destroys the hairs, which at the moment of the procedure are in an active phase of development. That's about 10-15% of all hairs in the treated area. The remaining hairs only slow down their growth, but are not permanently destroyed. That is why, with a one-off procedure, we cannot achieve a lasting effect. A course of procedures is required.

###What is the interval between procedures?

The course of laser hair removal is carried out with a break of three to five weeks (on average about a month) between procedures.

###Will the hairs stop growing forever after such a procedure?

Hair removal once and for all does not exist. After laser procedures, hairs that are in active growth are destroyed, but germ cells exist in our skin, from which, after a different period of time, hair development begins again. The hair coating of our skin is in a state of continuous self-renewal.

###What is the duration of a laser procedure?

The duration depends mostly on the area being processed. Extremely powerful lasers have the ability to operate with an increased pulse frequency, which makes the procedure fast and saves time for each client. For example, the epilation of the chin, above the upper or armpits lasts about 5-10 minutes, for a general bikini from 20 to 30 minutes, and for whole legs about 1 hour and 30 minutes.

###What should we expect after a laser procedure?

Hairs do not drop immediately after the procedure. This is observed 10 to 14 days after the hair removal. Even after the first procedure, part of the hair bulbs perish, and the rest atrophied, which externally manifests itself with thinning of the hair stems, slowing their growth and dripping.

###How should the area, which will be epilated by laser, be prepared?

In no case shall the hair be plucked by waxing or other mechanical method about two to three weeks before laser treatment. At the same time, immediately before the procedure itself, the hairs should be removed by shaving, depilating cream or trimmed tightly to the skin. This is necessary to minimize the feeling of discomfort during the procedure.

###What does it feel like during the procedure?

Procedures proceed quickly and practically painlessly. An important advantage of lasers in Incanto centers is the presence of a special cooling system that protects the skin from heating. This significantly reduces the feeling of pain during the procedure. After the procedure, a slight redness is noted, which disappears within 5-10 minutes after processing.

###How is it judged which laser to use?

After a detailed consultation with a doctor, the appropriate laser necessary for the procedure to be effective, because each patient is special and carries its individual characteristics.
