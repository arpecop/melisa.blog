Although at the beginning of your pregnancy you are still active and your body looks still unremarkable, the process that generates stretch marks has already begun. Therefore, it is important from now on to help your skin to resist their formation. Constant nourishment through oil with valuable oils, vitamins, salts and other important elements for the skin is needed.

Hormones are also to blame for fatigue, for a sharp change in moods, for drowsiness, irritability, but they are also a great excuse for all the emotions you experience :).

Accept changes and malaise with a smile â€“ this means that your body reacts properly to hormonal changes and prepares to create a cozy home for the little man.
