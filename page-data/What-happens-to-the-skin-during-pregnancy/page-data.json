They cause most changes in the body of a pregnant woman and have a huge effect on her skin. And the kilograms will constantly increase and begin to round the body more and more. These are just some of the reasons why care should be started with specialized products from the first day of pregnancy. Taking advantage of the help of cosmetics can preserve the beauty and health of the body during pregnancy. These are some products: shower oil, intimate gel, firming breast cream, elasticity oil, anti-stretch marks cream, cooling and soothing foot gel, soothing bean cream, firming body cream, warming anti-cellulite cream-gel.</p>\n<p>Pregnancy hormones (estrogen and progesterone) begin to rage in the body from the first weeks. Their hormone levels change dramatically. They determine both physical and emotional changes occur in the body.</p>\n<p>The breasts begin to get older and become very sensitive due to higher estrogen levels. The skin in pregnancy is stretched, the veins see. They change and the areolas – they expand, they become more convex and darken.</p>\n<p>Increased progesterone makes the skin drier or oilier, but once the baby is born it will regain its normal state.</p>\n<p>The change in the balance of hormones leads to changes in the physiology of the skin. Reduces salt production and disrupts the natural protection of the hydrolipidic layer. This leads to dehydration of the skin, redness, dryness and itching appear. One of the main irritants of the skin at this time are soaps and ordinary shower gels. They contain aggressive cleansing and combing ingredients that further aggravate the condition of the skin. Head for shower oil, which will not only cleanse your skin gently, but also preserve the strength of the water lipid layer.</p>\n<p>The pH of the intimate area during pregnancy is lower than ever in a woman's life. This is the body's natural weapon against the development of microorganisms and bacteria. A more acidic environment guarantees the health and comfort of the uterus. Most washing agents are more alkaline and can disrupt the natural balance. Use a washed intimate gel with a pH of between 3.5 and 4.5.</p>\n<p>Although at the beginning of your pregnancy you are still active and your body looks still unremarkable, the process that generates stretch marks has already begun. Therefore, it is important from now on to help your skin to resist their formation. Constant nourishment through oil with valuable oils, vitamins, salts and other important elements for the skin is needed.</p>\n<p>Hormones are also to blame for fatigue, for a sharp change in moods, for drowsiness, irritability, but they are also a great excuse for all the emotions you experience :).</p>\n<p>Accept changes and malaise with a smile – this means that your body reacts properly to hormonal changes and prepares to create a cozy home for the little man.</p>\n<p>Recomended Products:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37mEnnb\">Certified-Organic Intensive Belly &#x26; Body Stretch Mark Oil for Pregnancy | Powerful bio-compatible plant-extracts prevent and fade stretch marks better than a stretch mark cream or belly butter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3b8i85y\">Mederma Stretch Marks Therapy, Hydrates to Help Prevent Stretch Marks, Clinically Shown to Produce Noticable Improvement in 4 Weeks, Dermatologist Recommended, Ivory, 5.29 Ounce</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZmiMqp\">HATCH Mama - Natural Belly Oil Stretch Mark Smoothing Therapy | Non-Toxic, Plant-Derived, Mama-Safe (6.7 oz | 195 ml)</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 16, 2021","path":"/What-happens-to-the-skin-during-pregnancy","title":"What happens to the skin during pregnancy?","tags":["skin","pregnancy"],"description":"What happens to the skin during pregnancy?","author":"Melisa Laurini","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4970059880239521,"src":"/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/a7715/pregnancy.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/8f7df/pregnancy.jpg 250w,\n/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/0f3a1/pregnancy.jpg 500w,\n/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/a7715/pregnancy.jpg 1000w,\n/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/37d86/pregnancy.jpg 1500w,\n/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/a41d1/pregnancy.jpg 2000w,\n/static/9a73043845175a625d2f8b3662d8148a/69755/pregnancy.jpg 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/What-happens-to-the-skin-during-pregnancy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3897982121","4248876870"]}
