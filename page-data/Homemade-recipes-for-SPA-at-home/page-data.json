With a few homemade recipes you can achieve a spa at home.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To illuminate your face\nYou need:\nOne lemon\nThree whole strawberries\nOne banana</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This homemade face mask is sure to brighten your tired complexion. Vitamin C in strawberries lightens dark spots, lemons, and bananas soothe.</p>\n<p>Here is the SPA procedure:\nStrawberries and bananas are cut into cubes, then mixed in a bowl and mashed. Add the juice of one lemon and apply on the face, avoiding the eyes. Leave for 15 minutes or until the mask starts to feel dry. Rinse with lukewarm water.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Rejuvenating manicure\nYou need:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One lemon\nHalf a cucumber</p>\n<p>If your nails are yellow, all you need to do is soak them. White lemon colors nails, and cucumber soothes dry hands.</p>\n<p>SPA Procedure:\nCut the lemons and cucumbers in a bowl of lukewarm water. Soak your hands for ten minutes. Push the cuticles back as usual.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Exfoliating pedicure\nYou need:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Magnesium sulfate\nOlive oil\nBrown sugar</p>\n<p>We are sure that each of us has rough legs from time to time. To remove dead skin without the help of a professional, try this two-step pedicure. Magnesium salts relax tired legs, and brown sugar exfoliates the skin.</p>\n<p>SPA procedure:\nSoak your feet in warm water with magnesium sulfate salt for 10-15 minutes. Mix 2 parts olive oil with 3 parts brown sugar to create a rub. Rub on the feet and rinse thoroughly. Apply your favorite body lotion or foot cream. You can put on thick socks right away to retain moisture!</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Soaking the body\nYou need:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Milk Honey\nEssential oil (lavender works great!)</p>\n<p>This immersion is a traditional milk bath - it is said that Cleopatra did it all the time, so the routine practice has withstood the test of time. If you have a bathtub at your disposal, don't wait to try this relaxing, exfoliating bath. The lactic acid in milk helps to remove dead skin cells, and lavender and honey soothe and smell.</p>\n<p>SPA procedure:\nFill the tub with warm water as usual by adding a small amount of lavender and honey essential oil (this helps the aroma to spread through the water). Mix with about 4 glasses of milk. Use whole milk or buttermilk regularly if you feel fantastic. Be sure to do a quick rinse with a shower afterwards!</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Hair treatment\nYou need:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Olive oil\nYes, that's all. This simple conditioning treatment works quite well.</p>\n<p>SPA procedure:\nUse hair shampoo, as usual, in the shower. Then apply 2-4 tablespoons of olive oil on damp hair (skip the roots if the hair tends to be oily). Wrap your hair in a towel and leave for 10-15 minutes. Rinse your hair well.</p>\n<p>Recomended Products:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3u3Fbae\">Home Spa Gift Basket - Honey &#x26; Almond Scent - Luxury Bath &#x26; Body Set For Women and Men - Contains Shower Gel, Bubble Bath, Body Lotion, Bath Salt, Bath Bomb, Bath Puff &#x26; Handmade Weaved Basket</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dnsUHF\">New York Biology Dead Sea Mud Mask for Face and Body - Spa Quality Pore Reducer for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin, Natural Skincare for Women, Men - Tightens Skin for A Healthier Complexion - 8.8 oz</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZjtD4B\">Majestic Pure Himalayan Salt Body Scrub with Lychee Oil, Exfoliating Salt Scrub to Exfoliate &#x26; Moisturize Skin, Deep Cleansing - 10 oz</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 15, 2021","path":"/Homemade-recipes-for-SPA-at-home","title":"Homemade recipes for SPA at home","tags":["spa","homemade"],"description":"Homemade recipes for SPA at home","author":"Melisa Laurini","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4970059880239521,"src":"/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/a7715/spa.jpg","srcSet":"/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/8f7df/spa.jpg 250w,\n/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/0f3a1/spa.jpg 500w,\n/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/a7715/spa.jpg 1000w,\n/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/37d86/spa.jpg 1500w,\n/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/a41d1/spa.jpg 2000w,\n/static/61c570ffca6899d5a9a75cfad94177e7/69755/spa.jpg 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Homemade-recipes-for-SPA-at-home"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3897982121","4248876870"]}
