That is, it is recommended to phase in healthy and <strong>low-calorie foods</strong> on the menu.</p>\n<p>Abrupt changes in diet with a strong decrease in <strong>calorie intake</strong> may work in <strong>the short term,</strong> but do not yield <strong>long-term results</strong> and can even lead to <strong>yo-yo effect</strong>. Long-term fasting slows down our metabolism and does not bring any positive benefits to our body.</p>\n<p><strong>Balanced healthy</strong> eating in <strong>combination with moderate sports</strong> has been shown to lead to more gradual but long-term <strong>guaranteed positive results.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to finally get into <strong>the desired shape</strong>, only in a <strong>healthy way,</strong> then** follow** our healthy weight loss tips <strong>regularly</strong></p>\n<p>Basic rules for successful and healthy weight loss:</p>\n<p>To reduce the kilograms in our body you need to create a caloric deficiency. If we want to lose weight and achieve good results, low-calorie foods must be present in our diet, but they supply all the valuable nutrients our body needs to function properly. That is, it reduces calories to achieve a calorie deficit, but we do not compromise on the nutritional value of products. Only in this way can we achieve weight loss without ruining our metabolism and getting to undesirable conditions such as brittle, nails , hair loss and uncool appearance of the skin and others.</p>\n<p>All <strong>semi-finished products</strong>, products containing refined <strong>sugar</strong> and white flour, colours and <strong>preservatives</strong> are completely prohibited. Include a little less in your menu more fresh fruits and <strong>vegetables (multicolored seasonal and green leafy vegetables)</strong>. When we eat what nature has given us, we don't need to count every <strong>calorie</strong> and starve.</p>\n<p>When our goal is weight loss, the proteins in our food should overtake the amount of carbohydrates and fats, and fats should naturally be in the least amount. It is important in this case that they come from healthy vegetable sources of fat.</p>\n<p>In a healthy diet for weight loss is present:</p>\n<p><strong>50%</strong> high quality protein: chicken, turkey, veal, fish, eggs, low-fat cottage cheese, legumes (lentils, beans), various types of fish (mackerel, trout, salmon)</p>\n<p>**15% **healthy fats: olive oil, raw nuts, seeds, avocado, vegetable oils, fish and peanut butter</p>\n<p><strong>35%</strong> slow-digestible carbohydrates: <strong>potatoes, rice, oats, corn, pulses such as quinoa, buckwheat, amaranth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> of this type are slowly broken down by the body, maintaining the city for long as they do not sharply increase the level of insulin, as opposed to fast-absorption carbohydrates, which are contained in non-healthy foods.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Eat like a beggar at dinner\"</strong></p>\n<p>Avoid hearty meals in the evening. Then there is the time to skip the carbohydrates, as our body prepares for sleep and there is no need for this extra energy. Calories from accepted carbohydrates and sugars will not be consumed in the evening and they will be stored in the form of body fat.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/b6e58/food2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"alt_text\"\n        title=\"Avoid hearty meals in the evening\"\n        src=\"/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/b4294/food2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/75985/food2.jpg 150w,\n/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/f93b5/food2.jpg 300w,\n/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/b4294/food2.jpg 600w,\n/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/8e1fc/food2.jpg 900w,\n/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/e5166/food2.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7af7df0970a4861c03f0e64de9c04478/b6e58/food2.jpg 1430w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>It is good to take most of the carbohydrates for the day of** breakfast**, when our body needs the most energy, and our dinner to be light and poor in carbohydrates, with more attention paid to vegetables. Fruit intake is recommended to be at breakfast as they also contain sugars that we need more in the first part of the day.</p>\n<p>Prepare your food at home</p>\n<p>Cooking at home is the surest way to know** 100%** what's in our <strong>food</strong>. Yes, it takes longer than buying it, but it is most useful for our body. Often ready-made <strong>\"healthy\" foods</strong> in the shop network such as packaged salads, ready-made dressings, sandwiches and muesli are not so healthy at all.</p>\n<p>You just need to look at the label to find out about the preservatives they contain and make sure of the marketing tricks they fool us with every day. There are a number of foods on the market that are labeled healthy, but are actually quite caloric and contain sugar and preservatives. These are, for example, fruit juices, fruit milks.</p>\n<p>Avoid also using sauces such as ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise, as well as various dressings. Do your <strong>salad dressing</strong> only at <strong>home.</strong></p>\n<p>Read all labels</p>\n<p>Having mentioned labels, this is one of the things that you should not pass by if you really want to get a nice body. Not to mention the fact that some **manufacturers **even fail to mention some **ingredients **on the label, so choosing foods as close to nature as possible will guarantee us a quick result of the diet.</p>\n<h1><strong>Sample diet for weight loss</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>The diet is</strong> followed indefinitely, depending on your weight and type of metabolism. It is important to note that with each result come at different speeds , so arm yourself with patience.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 436px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/03efd501f866672ff55b4b1dc672ec56/939c5/food3.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 117.33333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"alt_text\"\n        title=\"and is recommended for overweight people\"\n        src=\"/static/03efd501f866672ff55b4b1dc672ec56/939c5/food3.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/03efd501f866672ff55b4b1dc672ec56/75985/food3.jpg 150w,\n/static/03efd501f866672ff55b4b1dc672ec56/f93b5/food3.jpg 300w,\n/static/03efd501f866672ff55b4b1dc672ec56/939c5/food3.jpg 436w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>It is very important not to give up and not despair if you \"sin\" at some point with an unhealthy temptation.
